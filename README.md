# 🛠️ Playground

Welcome to my **Playground** — a collection of small, fun projects I'm building as I learn programming. This space is dedicated to experimenting with new concepts, practicing coding skills, and having fun along the way.

## 📁 Projects

Here's a list of the current projects in this repository:

- 🎮 **pong** – A classic Pong game built with Python's `turtle` module.
- 🐍 **sssnake_game** – A simple snake game implementation.
- 🧠 **computer_quiz** – A basic quiz application to test your computer knowledge.
- 🎲 **higher_lower** – A game where you guess if the next number is higher or lower.

- 🎨 **turtle_random_walk_image** – Generates random walk patterns using turtles.
- 🖌️ **turtle_sketchpad** – A simple sketchpad using turtle graphics.

Feel free to explore each folder to see the code and try out the projects!

## 📌 Notes

- All projects are written in Python and are beginner-friendly.
- Most projects utilize the `turtle` module for graphics.
- No external libraries are required; Python's standard library is sufficient.
